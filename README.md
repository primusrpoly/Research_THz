# Machine Learning in THz Wireless Communications

## Introduction
This repository is prepared to provide the Python code for:
Modeling the Impact of Phase Noise in THz Communications Through Machine Learning: An Approach for Efficient Waveform Design

## Latest Updates
All necessary files have been added to the repository (05/07/2025)

## Installation
Copying the repository is the only step needed to reproduce study on a local machine.

## Data Preparation
All data used in our code is pulled from a MATLAB file titled 'full_Results.mat', which is found in every folder with Python code.

## File Structure
**data** - Hosts all MATLAB files for data storage, manipulation, and transformation

**excel** - Hosts all Excel files used for output once code is completed

**feature_prediction** - Hosts all feature prediction files, specifically abr_fp.py, one of the main achievements created in this paper

**new_dataset** - Hosts all regression files, including feature_importance, permutation_importance, select-k-best, test_vs_predicted, and final_results

- analysis - Files used for analyzing different weight combinations and for Differential Evolution hyperparameters
  
- snrviz - Visualization for 4D plot of data
  
**R** - Hosts work done in R, also for visualization
